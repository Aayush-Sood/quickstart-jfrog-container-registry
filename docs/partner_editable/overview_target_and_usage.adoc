https://jfrog.com/container-registry/[JFrog Container Registry^] is a docker repository manager, capable of hosting all of
your docker images, helm charts and generic binaries, on AWS resources. This Quick Start provides a turnkey solution deploying JFrog Container Registry into AWS.

This Quick Start is for administrators who want the flexibility, scale, and availability of
AWS through products such as virtual private clouds (VPCs), Amazon Elastic Compute
Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Elastic Load Balancing
(ELB), and Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) to deploy Container Registry as
their docker repository manager.

Amazon EC2, along with Amazon S3 and Amazon RDS, forms the foundation for the
deployment. By using Amazon S3 and Amazon RDS as persistent storage for artifacts and
the configuration, respectively, Container Registry can be completely redeployed, scaled up, or
scaled down, depending on your requirements. This configuration allows organizations to
save on costs for multiple secondary nodes and to pay only for storage used.

The default installation creates two https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/what-is-amazon-ec2-auto-scaling.html[Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling^] groups:

* The first Auto Scaling group is responsible for the primary node and ensures that the
node.id for HA is set to `primary` and that there is always only one primary node.

The Auto Scaling groups are monitored by the Classic Load Balancer, which is configured
with https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/elb-healthchecks.html[health checks^] that validate the Container Registry service is up and running. If the endpoint
returns an error response, a new node is recovered within 10 minutes.
