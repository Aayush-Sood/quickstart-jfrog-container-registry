. Connect to Container Registry from `JFrogContainerRegistryUrl`. You can find `JFrogContainerRegistryUrl` on the *Outputs* tab of the Container Registry primary stack. Verify that you can view the login screen (see <<get_started_1>>).

NOTE: If you use a non-CA-signed certificate, you will receive a certificate warning when you attempt to access the page. This happens because the certificate doesn’t
match the ELB DNS unless you configure Amazon Route 53.

== Updating Container Registry
// If Post-deployment steps are required, add them here. If not, remove the heading

If maintenance must be performed on the stack, ensure that you update the
CloudFormation stack rather than updating the infrastructure manually (this also applies to
updating Container Registry). The Container Registry version for this Quick Start is *7.0.x*.

NOTE: Because the instances are backed by an AWS Marketplace AMI, the version you update must be available in AWS Marketplace, and a new map must be created
in the CloudFormation templates. Otherwise, the update will fail.

. Choose the root stack, and then choose *Update* (see <<update_2>>).

. Shut down the *ContainerRegistryMaster* node. The proper process shuts down the nodes one at a time, starting with the Container Registry primary node. This will trigger a health check
failure on the load balancer. The load balancer will then delete the current running primary node and deploy a new primary node with the updated version (see <<update_7>>).

== Security
// Provide post-deployment best practices for using the technology on AWS, including considerations such as migrating data, backups, ensuring high performance, high availability, etc. Link to software documentation for detailed information.

By default, the load balancer does not match your certificate. You must configure the DNS
according to your organization’s configuration, which is highly recommended for a
production deployment.
When you create a new VPC, the private subnet CIDR is automatically provided to the
database security group `ArtifactoryBDSG`. In the new VPC, the private subnet is accessible
only from the public subnet.
When you deploy to an existing VPC, ensure similar rules are followed so that your
Container Registry node is not accessible directly from the internet. Also, ensure that the private
CIDR is correct and locked down. Avoid using `0.0.0.0/0`. If the subnet is a public subnet, it
will allow your PosgressSQL database to be available from the internet.

== Storage
//Provide any other information of interest to users, especially focusing on areas where AWS or cloud usage differs from on-premises usage.

A major difference between running on-premises and on AWS is storage. Because S3 is
used, you are charged for what is currently in use rather than what may be allocated onpremises. Ensure to https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Monitoring+Storage[monitor your usage^].
